# chrome-clean-search

A chrome extension to return to an older better google search. Namely by excluding junk like the AI synopsis that hallucinates constantly :)

This is achieved by applying the `&udm=14` search parameter to any google search queries.

This project was inspired by [udm14.com](https://www.udm14.com)

## Using this extension now

Its under review for the chrome store so for now you can load it as an unpacked extension:

**1) Clone this repo**

`git clone https://github.com/aria-afk/chrome-clean-search.git`

**2) Open chrome and navigate to the extensions tab**

`chrome://extensions/`

**3) If not already enabled in the top right toggle "Developer mode" on**

**4) On the top left click "Load unpacked" and select the path to this repo.**

Then enjoy~

## TODO:
- Ability to navigate post udm14 search to any type (navigating off a web section will just re-route back to web right now.)

## Features I want to/will add

- Ability to toggle on/off through a UI instead of through the extension manager.
