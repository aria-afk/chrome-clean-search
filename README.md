# chrome-clean-search

A chrome extension to return to an older better google search. Namely by excluding junk like the AI synopsis that hallucinates constantly :)

This is achieved by applying the `&udm=14` search parameter to any google search queries.

This project was inspired by [udm14.com](https://www.udm14.com)

## Features I want to/will add

- Ability to toggle on/off through a UI instead of through the extension manager.
